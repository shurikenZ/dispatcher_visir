Interactive Lab Verify Coupon Template
=======================

The VISIR Lab Client makes use of the Template of Interactive Engine in PHP (https://github.com/OnlineLabs4All/Template-of-Interactive-Engine-in-PHP).

## How to start?
Change $authUser, $authPass and $X_apikey in index.php. You get them from the Dispatcher (http://dispatcher.onlinelabs4all.org/) by creating a new Experiment Engine.

## setups.json
The id always has to be identic to the key name it is stored in. Double quotes (") need to be escaped with backslash (\\).
